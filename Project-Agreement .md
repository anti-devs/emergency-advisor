# Anti-Devs team 

# Project Agreement 

## Project Idea and Description: 

* Idea: emergency advisor 

* Desc: this website will help anyone who has an emergency or a medical situation that should be dealt with as soon as possible. For example, imagine someone having a heart attack in front of you, then to act fast and avoid any complications you can head to the website and type "or" select from a list of images describing the situation, and then brief simple steps on how to act. Another page will have more details about the medical condition you encountered, in order to understand how it happened and how to avoid it in the future. Another page will have some random daily tips about various medical conditions and any related information about them, in addition to another page for providing tips and instructions on how to deal with someone with a specific chronic condition like diabetes. The last two or one page will have info about contacts and what services we provide. Our main focus is to make the web page as accessible as possible since we are dealing with sensitive things or situations. 

## Team members: 

* Hamza Ahmad (Team Leader) 

* Ahmad Smadi  

* Murad Alkhatib 

* Tahany Ali 

* Noortan  

* Ashrf Obeidat 

## Cooperation Plan: 

For Ahmad, he believes that by his skills with problem solving he will be able to overcome any challenge we as a team will face, he is also a team player, so he can deal with team members with ease and respect their emotions and needs. Speaking about Noortan, she almost never misses a deadline, her ability to work under pressure allows her to manage her time successfully, she is also highly motivated since she believes that every opportunity she faces or gets will definitely help her improve herself. Tahany as we refer to her as “having the eyes of a falcon” she has an amazing attention to details that she never ignores any aspect of the project at hand, she is also highly motivated but not like anyone else, but she says that problem solving always gives her a relief since she believes just like Ahmad, that this will definitely make her a better person. When talking about Ashrf, his patience is astounding, he barely complains about anything, and when facing an issue, he does not just stand there and stares at it, but he tries to understand it and act immediately which something that requires patience, resilience and creative thinking skills. Hamza has the ability to break down the most complex ideas or concepts to their simplest, and then trying to connect the dots and building again from the ground up. Murad is a fast learner, he is like really quick, but usually when considering speed, we lose quality, but this is not the case with Murad, he simply combines quality and speed which makes him an excellent team member, his calmness adds to the atmosphere of the team.  

Our plan to ensure that everyone is on the same page is to firstly distribute the tasks on the members equally taking into consideration their strength points and skills, and we will also focus on conducting regular meetings to discuss what we have done so far and explain to the others who might have issues with understanding. 

 

## Conflict Plan: 

Our strategy to deal with conflicts includes conducting meeting for the whole group and discuss the conflict, as we will also let the team leader conduct a meeting with the members having a conflict, and if he does not manage, he will escalate to the TA team. We will try to understand the reason of the conflict and try to remind the ones having the conflict that our main purpose is to complete the project, and each conflict will definitely affect our performance and meeting the deadlines, taking into consideration not violating anyone’s rights, but we will mainly focus on preventing the conflict in the first place, and focus on supporting each other and offer help all the time since it is not just a personal project, but it is for the team. 

 

## Communication Plan: 

* We agreed on leaving the communication channels open all the time, or in case someone has to do something important he will tell us so that we reorganize our schedule to adapt to this change. 

* We will use Trello, Zoom, Slack, phone. 

* We agreed on taking a one-hour break at 1:00 pm, and another shorter break at 6:00 pm. 

* In case someone faces an issue or a misunderstanding with some tasks and we start to feel that she or he is falling behind, we will try to push ourselves harder in order to finish out task faster in order to try to help that member. 

* Also, on Zoom and by phone after work hours. 

* We will not focus on allocating a specific amount of time for speaking, but instead, we will try let every member speak as he or she wills, since some of us will need more time to explain what they want, and the other might need shorter time, so in order to avoid generating stress, we will stick to this plan. 

 

## Work Plan 

We will discuss the general idea, then move to the specifics, we will try to break down the overall problem into sub-problems and from there, we will discuss which team member has the time and the skills to deal with one of these sub-problems based on different criteria, taking into consideration not to let her or him deal with more than they can do. We will use Trello as a project management tool. 

 

## Git Process 

* All the components of the project will be hosted on GitHub. 

* Using GitHub organization 

* Our Git flow will include the following: we will start with main branch after adding the necessary files, then every team member will clone the main branch and pull changes once the reviewer and merger agree that there are no conflicts. We will also have tagged branches for testing things and others for features and extra features. We might have one code reviewer and one merger, who will have to communicate and coordinate the version control related matters and then approve for the members who want to push their changes.
