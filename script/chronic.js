    "Diabetes is a chronic (long-lasting) health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. \nMost of the food you eat is broken down into sugar (also called glucose) and released into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin acts like a key to let the blood sugar into your body’s cells for use as energy.\nIf you have diabetes, your body either doesn’t make enough insulin or can’t use the insulin it makes as well as it should. When there isn’t enough insulin or cells stop responding to insulin, too much blood sugar stays in your bloodstream. Over time, that can cause serious health problems, such as heart disease, vision loss, and kidney disease. ",

Having blood pressure measures consistently above normal may result in a diagnosis of high blood pressure (or hypertension).\nThe higher your blood pressure levels, the more risk you have for other health problems, such as heart disease, heart attack, and stroke.",

    "Blood pressure often increases as weight increases. Being overweight also can cause disrupted breathing while you sleep (sleep apnea), which further raises your blood pressure.\nWeight loss is one of the most effective lifestyle changes for controlling blood pressure. Losing even a small amount of weight if you're overweight or obese can help reduce your blood pressure. In general, you may reduce your blood pressure by about 1 millimeter of mercury (mm Hg) with each kilogram (about 2.2 pounds) of weight you lose.\nBesides shedding pounds, you generally should also keep an eye on your waistline. Carrying too much weight around your waist can put you at greater risk of high blood pressure.",

For many people exercise may, in fact, be the best medicine.\nBe sure to discuss exercise with your doctor, to learn what kinds of exercise might be most advantageous for people with your kind of heart disease, and how to get started with it safely. For many people, beginning with a formal cardiac rehabilitation program is the best way to get started.",
